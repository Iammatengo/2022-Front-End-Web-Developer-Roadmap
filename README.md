This is my ultimate guide to becoming a front-end web developer in 2022 with resources.

There are a lot of free courses you can learn from. Below I have listed some of the best from YouTube. If you don't like learning with videos, I recommend you start your journey on [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

## #100daysOfCode

I highly recommend that you join the #100DaysOfCode challenge on twitter. This challenge will help you to learn in public by coding for not less than an hour each day and sharing your progress on twitter. You will become more consistent this way and you will also surround yourself with a good community of developers. Learn more about the challenge on the official website: https://www.100daysofcode.com/

1. **Command-line/Terminal:**
   Knowing your terminal well will give you full control of your computer and workflow. As a front-end dev you will need the terminal to work with git, install dependencies and run the application. You will also feel like you have super-powers while working with a terminal ‚ö°

1. **Code Editor (Visual Studio Code):**
   A code editor is simply a tool that you will be using to write your code. I personally work with visual studio code and I love it üòç

1. **HTML/CSS:**
   HTML and CSS is the backbone of web development. They are also easy to learn but require a lot of practice to master. You will need HTML to add webpage content and CSS to style the content. CSS is like an art, become creative and have fun with it üñå

1. **CSS(Framework) - Bootstrap/TailwindCSS:**
   A CSS framework simply makes it easy and fast to build UIs. Have a solid understanding of CSS before you start using a Framework. In 2022 I recommend TailwindCSS.

1. **Git and GitHub:**
   At this point you can dive into git and GitHub. They will help you to track changes, share projects and even collaborate on open source projects.

1. **JavaScript**
   It's time for the big dog üê∂ JavaScript is the most important programming language of the web. It's also so huge, I recommend learning the fundamentals first and then going into advanced topics after learning at least one JS framework. Be patient with JavaScript and practice with projects. At the end of the day it will start paying your bills üí∞

1. **JavaScript Framework (React, Vue, Angular, Svelt):**
   There are many popular JS Frameworks so far. It will be confusing to choose one. Decide depending on company you want to work at or job description. If you don't know which is which, go with React. It's popular in terms of jobs. Vue is loved by most developers though.
